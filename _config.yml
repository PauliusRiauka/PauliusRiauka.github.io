   <strong>C++</strong>: This programming language has been my first programming tool as well as my generally preferred tool for the past five years. I have used this language to create numerous projects for university related tasks as well as personal projects.<br/><br/>
   <strong>C</strong>: I have been exercising this language for the past three years with an ambition to have as complete control of the program execution speed as possible without sacrifising<br/><br/>
   <strong>Python</strong> I have found this language very useful during an attempt to use Raspberry Pi as a microcontroller for an embedded system. This has given be great basics of the language and it's use cases.<br/><br/>
   <strong>MATLAB/ Simulink</strong>: These programs have proven to be a very valuable tool to easily asess feasibility of a hypothesis and therefore were used for nearly every university related project throughout my studies. <br/><br/>
   <strong>Web Development</strong>: Through building web applications, I have also worked with various client side technology, having used jQuery, Bootstrap, LESS, SASS, Backbone/Underscore/Require. More recently I have written React applications (primarily using the Create React App framework, and extending them)<br/><br/>
   <strong>Development Control</strong>: I have a good knowledge of application life-cycle management and have worked with SVN, Git, Maven, Gradle, Sonar, Jenkins, TeamCity, etc. I have experience with an array of testing tools and technologies.<br/><br/>
   I have also gained experience and knowledge of other technologies from several side projects and research that I have undertaken in my free time, including Android, a variety of social APIs (Twitter etc) and cloud platforms such as CloudFoundry/OpenShift/AppFog/AWS. <br/><br/>
   As part of Nerdability, I created, and am now primary contributor to, two Spring projects - <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/robhinds/spring-social-geeklist">Spring-Social-Geeklist</a> and <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/nerdability/spring-social-khan-academy">Spring-Social-Khan-Academy</a>, which provide core integration with those third-party APIs on top of the Spring Social framework. They are both listed as community projects: <a target='_blank' href="https://projects.spring.io/spring-social/">https://projects.spring.io/spring-social/</a>. <br/><br/>
   I write a blog covering technical and opinion articles that can be found here: <a target='_blank' href="https://automateddeveloper.blogspot.com/">automateddeveloper.blogspot.com</a> (I am also a <a target='_blank' href="https://dzone.com/users/899489/rhinds.html">DZone MVB</a>)
